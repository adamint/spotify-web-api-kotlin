     *
     * **Information from Spotify**:
     * Writing a Query - Guidelines
     *
     * Keyword matching:
     *
     * Matching of search keywords is not case-sensitive. Operators, however, should be specified in uppercase. Unless surrounded by double quotation marks, keywords are matched in any order. For example: q=roadhouse&20blues matches both “Blues Roadhouse” and “Roadhouse of the Blues”. q="roadhouse&20blues" matches “My Roadhouse Blues” but not “Roadhouse of the Blues”.
     *
     * Searching for playlists returns results where the query keyword(s) match any part of the playlist’s name or description. Only popular public playlists are returned.
     *
     * Operator: The operator NOT can be used to exclude results.
     *
     * For example: q=roadhouse%20NOT%20blues returns items that match “roadhouse” but excludes those that also contain the keyword “blues”.
     *
     * Similarly, the OR operator can be used to broaden the search: q=roadhouse%20OR%20blues returns all the results that include either of the terms. Only one OR operator can be used in a query.
     *
     * Note: Operators must be specified in uppercase. Otherwise, they are handled as normal keywords to be matched.
     *
     * Wildcards: The asterisk (*) character can, with some limitations, be used as a wildcard (maximum: 2 per query). It matches a variable number of non-white-space characters. It cannot be used:
    - in a quoted phrase
    - in a field filter
    - when there is a dash (“-“) in the query
    - or as the first character of the keyword string Field filters: By default, results are returned when a match is found in any field of the target object type. Searches can be made more specific by specifying an album, artist or track field filter.
     *
     * For example: The query q=album:gold%20artist:abba&type=album returns only albums with the text “gold” in the album name and the text “abba” in the artist name.
     *
     * To limit the results to a particular year, use the field filter year with album, artist, and track searches.
     *
     * For example: q=bob%20year:2014
     *
     * Or with a date range. For example: q=bob%20year:1980-2020 To retrieve only albums released in the last two weeks, use the field filter tag:new in album searches.
     *
     * To retrieve only albums with the lowest 10% popularity, use the field filter tag:hipster in album searches. Note: This field filter only works with album searches.
     *
     * Depending on object types being searched for, other field filters, include genre (applicable to tracks and artists), upc, and isrc. For example: q=lil%20genre:%22southern%20hip%20hop%22&type=artist. Use double quotation marks around the genre keyword string if it contains spaces.
     *
     * **[Api Reference](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/search/search/)**
     *
     * @param query Search query keywords and optional field filters and operators.
     * @param searchTypes A list of item types to search across. Search results include hits from all the specified item types.
     * @param limit Maximum number of results to return.
    Default: 20
    Minimum: 1
    Maximum: 50
    Note: The limit is applied within each type, not on the total response.
    For example, if the limit value is 3 and the type is artist,album, the response contains 3 artists and 3 albums.
     * @param offset The index of the first result to return.
    Default: 0 (the first result).
    Maximum offset (including limit): 10,000.
    Use with limit to get the next page of search results.
     * @param market If a country code is specified, only artists, albums, and tracks with content that is playable in that market is returned. Note:
    - Playlist results are not affected by the market parameter.
    - If market is set to from_token, and a valid access token is specified in the request header, only content playable in the country associated with the user account, is returned.
    - Users can view the country that is associated with their account in the account settings. A user must grant access to the [SpotifyScope.USER_READ_PRIVATE] scope prior to when the access token is issued.
     * @param includeExternal If true, the response will include any relevant audio content that is hosted externally. By default external content is filtered out from responses.
