/**
 * General attributes of a [Track]
 *
 * @property acousticness A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.
 * 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
 * @property analysisUrl An HTTP URL to access the full audio analysis of this track.
 * An access token is required to access this data.
 * @property danceability Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination
 * of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of
 * 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.
 * @property durationMs The duration of the track in milliseconds.
 * @property energy Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and
 * activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy,
 * while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include
 * dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
 * @property id The Spotify ID for the track.
 * @property instrumentalness Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are
 * treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer
 * the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.
 * Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as
 * the value approaches 1.0.
 * @property key The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation.
 * E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.
 * @property liveness Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent
 * an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood
 * that the track is live.
 * @property loudness The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across
 * the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a
 * sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range
 * between -60 and 0 db.
 * @property mode Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which
 * its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.
 * @property speechiness Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively
 * speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.
 * Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33
 * and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including
 * such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
 * @property tempo The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo
 * is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.
 * @property timeSignature An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a
 * notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).
 * @property trackHref A link to the Web API endpoint providing full details of the track.
 * @property type The object type: “audio_features”
 * @property uri The Spotify URI for the track.
 * @property valence A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
 * Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low
 * valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
