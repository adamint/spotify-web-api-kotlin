## Downloading
This library is available via Maven Central. 

### Maven:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.adamratzman</groupId>
    <artifactId>spotify-api-kotlin</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle
```
compile group: 'com.adamratzman', name: 'spotify-api-kotlin', version: '2.1.1'
```

To use the latest snapshot instead, you must add the Jitpack repository
```
repositories {
	maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```
Then, you can use the following:
```
dependencies {
	compile 'com.github.adamint:spotify-web-api-kotlin:dev-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

#### Android
This library should work out of the box on Android.

## Documentation
The `spotify-web-api-kotlin` KDocs are live at https://adamint.github.io/spotify-web-api-kotlin/-spotify-kotlin-wrapper/

## Creating a SpotifyAPI or SpotifyClientAPI object
In order to use the methods in this library, you must create either a `SpotifyAPI` or `SpotifyClientAPI` object using their respective exposed builders. Client-specific methods are unable to be accessed with the generic SpotifyAPI, rather you must create an instance of the Client API.

### SpotifyAPI
The SpotifyAPI `Token` automatically regenerates when needed.
To build it, you must pass the application id and secret.
```kotlin
import com.adamratzman.spotify.main.SpotifyScope
import com.adamratzman.spotify.main.spotifyApi

spotifyApi {
    credentials {
        clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
        clientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
    }
}.buildCredentialed()
```
*Note:* You are **unable** to use any client endpoint without authenticating with the methods below. 

### SpotifyClientAPI
All endpoints inside `SpotifyAPI` can be accessed within the `SpotifyClientAPI`.
Its automatic refresh is available *only* when building with
an authorization code or a `Token` object. Otherwise, it will expire `Token#expires_in` seconds after creation.

You have two options when building the Client API.
1. You can use [Implicit Grant access tokens](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#implicit_grant_flow) with 
`Builder.buildToken(token: String)`. However, this is a one-time token that cannot be refreshed.
2. You can use the [Authorization code flow](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#authorization_code_flow). We provide a method
with `Builder.buildAuthCode(code: String, automaticRefresh: Boolean)`to generate the flow url with Builder.getAuthUrl(vararg spotifyScopes: Scope), allowing you to request specific 
spotifyScopes. This library does not provide a method to retrieve the code from your 
callback URL. You must implement that with a web server. This method allows you 
to choose whether to use automatic token refresh.

## What is the SpotifyRestAction class?
I wanted users of this library to have as much flexibility as possible. This 
includes options for asynchronous and blocking execution in all endpoints. However, 
 due to this, you **must** call one of the provided methods in order for the call 
 to execute! The `SpotifyRestAction` provides four methods for use: 1 blocking and 3 async.
- `complete()` blocks the current thread and returns the result
- `queue()` executes and immediately returns
- `queue(consumer: (T) -> Unit)` executes the provided callback as soon as the request 
is asynchronously evaluated
- `queueAfter(quantity: Int, timeUnit: TimeUnit, consumer: (T) -> Unit)` executes the 
provided callback after the provided time. As long as supplier execution is less than the provided 
time, this will likely be accurate within a few milliseconds.
- `asFuture()` transforms the supplier into a `CompletableFuture` 

### SpotifyRestPagingAction
Separate from SpotifyRestAction, this specialized implementation of RestActions is 
just for [PagingObject]. This class gives you the same functionality as SpotifyRestAction, 
but you also have the ability to retrieve *all* of its items or linked PagingObjects with 
a single method call to `getAllItems()` or `getAllPagingObjects()` respectively


## Using the Library
### The benefits of LinkedResults, PagingObjects, and Cursor-based Paging Objects
Spotify provides these three object models in order to simplify our lives as developers. So let's see what we
can do with them!

#### PagingObjects
PagingObjects are a container for the requested objects (`items`), but also include 
important information useful in future calls. It contains the request's `limit` and `offset`, along with 
(sometimes) a link to the next and last page of items and the total number of items returned.

If a link to the next or previous page is provided, we can use the `getNext` and `getPrevious` methods to retrieve 
the respective PagingObjects 

#### Cursor-Based Paging Objects
A cursor-based paging object is a PagingObject with a cursor added on that can be used as a key to find the next 
page of items. The value in the cursor, `after`, describes after what object to begin the query.

Just like with PagingObjects, you can get the next page of items with `getNext`. *However*, there is no 
provided implementation of `after` in this library. You will need to do it yourself, if necessary.

#### LinkedResults
Some endpoints, like `PlaylistsAPI.getPlaylistTracks`, return a LinkedResult, which is a simple wrapper around the 
list of objects. With this, we have access to its Spotify API url (with `href`), and we provide simple methods to parse 
that url.

### Generic Request
For obvious reasons, in most cases, making asynchronous requests via `queue` or `queueAfter` is preferred. However, 
the synchronous format is also shown.

```kotlin
import com.adamratzman.spotify.main.SpotifyScope
import com.adamratzman.spotify.main.spotifyApi

val spotifyApi = spotifyApi {
    credentials {
        clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
        clientSecret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
    }
}.buildCredentialed()

// block and print out the names of the twenty most similar songs to the search
spotifyApi.search.searchTrack("Début de la Suite").complete().map { it.name }.joinToString().let { println(it) }

// now, let's do it asynchronously
spotifyApi.search.searchTrack("Début de la Suite").queue { it.map { it.name }.joinToString().let { println(it) } }

// simple, right? what about if we want to print ou the featured playlists message from the "Overview" tab?
spotifyApi.browse.getFeaturedPlaylists().complete().message.let { println(it )}

// easy! let's try something a little harder
// let's find out Bénabar's Spotify ID, find his top tracks, and print them out

spotifyApi.search.searchArtist("Bénabar").complete()[0].id.let { id -> 
    spotifyApi.artists.getArtistTopTracks(id).complete().joinToString { it.name }.let { println(it) }
 }
```

### Track Relinking
Spotify keeps many instances of most tracks on their servers, available in different markets. As such, if we use endpoints 
that return tracks, we do not know if these tracks are playable in our market. That's where track relinking comes in.

To relink in a specified market, we must supply a `market` parameter for endpoints where available. 
In both Track and SimpleTrack objects in an endpoint response, there is a nullable field called `linked_from`. 
If the track is unable to be played in the specified market and there is an alternative that *is* playable, this 
will be populated with the href, uri, and, most importantly, the id of the track.

You can then use this track in clientApi actions such as playing or saving the track, knowing that it will be playable 
in your market!
